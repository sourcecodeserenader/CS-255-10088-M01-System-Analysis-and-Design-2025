## 1. Project summary  
I worked with DriverPass, a driving school that needed one cloud based system for everything. Students can sign up for online classes, take practice exams and book in person lessons. I set up a portal where students can schedule lessons, change them or cancel them. Instructors can log how each student is doing. Administrators see new rules from the Department of Motor Vehicles show up automatically.

## 2. What I did particularly well  
I turned our goals into a clear list of what the system must do and how it must behave. I drew diagrams that map out each user’s journey through the system. I also laid out our cloud setup in the design document so developers know exactly where to start building.

## 3. One part I would revise  
If I could go back I would simplify the step by step diagrams. I would show what happens when errors occur and label the different paths a user might take. That would make it easier for anyone to see the common issues and know how to handle them.

## 4. Interpreting and implementing user needs  
I collected every feature request and matched it to an item in the requirements document. For example two big needs were secure login and automatic updates from the Department of Motor Vehicles. By tying each request to a requirement I made sure nothing slipped through the cracks. Putting the user’s real problems first is the only way to build a system that truly helps.

## 5. Future design approach  
Next time I will start with user stories and talk with everyone involved to decide what to build first. I will sketch simple screen ideas early and get feedback before adding more detail. I will work in short cycles, plan each cycle and share progress often so the design stays focused on user needs and delivers value every step of the way.
